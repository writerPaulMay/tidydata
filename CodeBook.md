#About the tidy data set

The tidy data set produced for this project is `tidy_set.csv`.

The tidy data set is a new data frame which combines original data from the provided `test` and `train` files.

Columns were removed during the tidying process, as described in the *Features* section below.

Guidance for improving the meaning and readability of the feature names came from `features_info.txt`.

The expanded activity names came from `activity_labels.txt`.

The tidy data set is ordered by activity in alphabetical order and then by subject in ascending order.

---

#Activities

There were six possible activities that could be carried out by subjects. 

In the raw data sets, activities were indicated by the numbers 1 through 6. 

These have been expanded to their associated textual values in the tidy data set.

---

#Features

The features in the tidy data set come from processed accelerometer and gyroscope signals generated by smartphones worn by subjects during activities.

Only features relating to mean and standard deviation values were retained from the raw data sets and included in the tidy data set. 

Every feature value is the calculated mean of the original data for each subject/activity combination.

The feature names begin with `time` or `frequency`. These strings replace the `t` and `f` prefixes from the raw data sets.

The feature names include `Accelerometer` or `Gyroscope` to indicate the type of signal being reported. These strings replace the `Acc` and `Gyro` abbreviations from the raw data sets. Similarly, `Magnitude` replaces `Mag` from the raw data sets.

The suffix values `X`, `Y` and `Z` refer to 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The string `std` has been retained as a reasonable abbreviation for standard deviation.

All brackets embedded in the original feature names have been removed for ease of reading.

 [1] `activity` 
     A string indicating one of six categories: `laying`, `sitting`, `standing`, `walking`, `walking_downstairs` and `walking_upstairs`  
                                           
 [2] `subject`
     An integer in the range 1 to 30 indicating the person whose activity was measured
